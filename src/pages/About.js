            I'm Amelia
            I am a junior web developer currently living in Brisbane, Australia. I have always enjoyed creating things from hacking together my personal myspace page to drawing and painting.  I am a well-organised person, a problem solver with high attention to detail who is always up for a challange. On my days off I enjoy art, drag shows, hanging out with my dog Leeroy and playing MMORPGâ€™s.
