# React Portfolio

My new portfolio was created with React, CSS, and Html.

## Deployed site

## About

This portfolio was built to test my new skills with react and to update my original basic HTML one ( which can be seen further down in my repositories). This site was styled with early windows theming in mind with the use of personal pixel art.  

The site looks best on desktops and tablets. It works on mobile but looked ugly so I need to think of a more creative way to display it.

## Sprinkles (future features)

The site is 90% finished there are some features i would like to implement when I learn how to. (as of this point, June 2022, I have spent 10 weeks learning React from Coder Academy)

Click the x on the div to close the window.
When a div is open have it correspond to the footer.
Create a better way to view it on a mobile device.
Have it so multiple windows can be left open.
